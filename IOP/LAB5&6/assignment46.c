// THIS IS PROGRAM TO :
// (USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS):
// Letâ€™s move away from vegetables and turn to a more practical application. You can 
// use arrays in a program to avoid a significant health and safety issue. As you may 
// know, wearing a hat that is too large is dangerous. It can fall over your eyes, so 
// you may bump into things, causing injury or even death. Equally, wearing a hat 
// that is too small can result in persistent headaches and make you look foolish. 
// This invaluable program will use arrays to work out your correct hat size in the 
// units commonly used in the United States and the United Kingdom, where hat 
// sizes typically vary from 6 1/2 to 7 7/8. Other countries have more transparent 
// hat sizes that cause fewer problems at home, but if you are a foreign visitor to the 
// United States or the United Kingdom, buying a hat while you are away can be even 
// more hazardous. You just enter the circumference of your head, in inches of 
// course, and your hat size will be displayed instantly:
// Program 5.6 Know your hat size - if you dare...
